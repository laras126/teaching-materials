Let's get our hands in some code right off the bat. Be prepared to make mistakes and do a lot of Googling!

If you like, work through the following tasks to get you started:

1. Change the page text
2. Add another image
3. Add a link
4. Give the page a background image
5. Put a border around the image
6. Make the paragraph span only half of the screen
7. Stretch an image so it looks really distorted
8. Use an uncommon HTML5 element
9. Use a webfont
10. Add a drop shadow to one of the images

Super ultimate bonus:
11. Make some things bounce around with animate.css

If you don't like those, do whatever you want!
