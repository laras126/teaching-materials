## Assignment 1

This repo is a completed version of a big, huge task list given to students learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I usually walk them through creating a project folder and initial files, then they are given this list:

### A couple of notes:

* All styles must be done in CSS, e.g. ```<p color="green">``` is not allowed!
* There are multiple ways to accomplish each task (some better than others!).

#### Level 1

1. Create three paragraphs of text
2. Add two images, one using a relative path and one an 3. absolute path
3. Make two lists: one with numbers, one with bullet points
4. Add a button and a text input to the page

#### Level 2

1. Make a dashed border around the images
2. Give each paragraph a heading
3. Add a non-repeating background image
4. Change the color of the paragraph headings

#### Level 3

1. Create another page and link to it from the original page
2. On that page, create a box
3. Now make three more boxes
4. Make one of those boxes green, the others blue

#### Level 4

1. Make the green box red when you hover over it
2. Create another list, without numbers or bullet points
3. Make the first letter of every paragraph's heading a different color
4. Add a different color and bigger border to the images when they are hovered over

#### Bonus!

Keep the image from jumping when the border shows on hover
