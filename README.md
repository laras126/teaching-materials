# Teaching Materials

This is a repo of the assignments, demos and what not I use in my teaching. These should be cleverly in submodules somehow, but I'm not sure of the best way to do it so that I can keep track of both the solutions and the blank assignments.

Anyhow, the content is three fold:

#### Assignments

These are big, long lists of to-dos for students to work through.

#### Demos

Um, well, demos. Mostly of specific concepts like forms or jQuery.

#### Exercises

These are kind of like smaller assignments, but for in class. Ideally pair programmed.
